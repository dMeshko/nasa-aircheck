# RESOURCES USED
-We used the <a href="#">text to speech module</a> to ease the access to the visually impaired, and to add a warm welcome to the users. After that we had a Skype conference with a representative from IBM and got advice about using their modules for further development of the application.
-We also used the local meteorological website that uses data, calculations and measurements from weather stations spread all across the country (Macedonia). The data provided by these weather stations is allowed for public use (open data).
-For the data to calculate the measurements like Air Quality Index we used the open-data provided by the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning.
-We didn't want to work in a "closed" box, so we also exchanged ideas and opinions with a team in Algeria through a Skype conference, the team was also working on the same project (Aircheck).
-We spoke to an expert in the field of climate changes, Dragana Bojovic from NASA / USAID
